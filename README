the little nymph is for teaching purpose only.

it reuses the code and idea
of the early version of cicada-language,

to teach my friends
how to implement a interpreter
of a simple programming language.

I will use assembly language (FASM for x86-64)
to implement the interpreter.

the programming language to be implemented
is a threaded-code based (Forth-like) language.
