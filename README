the little nymph is for teaching purpose only

it reuses the code and idea
of the early version of cicada-language

to teach my friends
how to implement a interpreter
of a simple programming language

I will use assembly language (FASM for x86-64)
to implement the interpreter

the programming language to be implemented
is a threaded-code based (Forth-like) language

two versions of the interpreter is implemented
one for linux
one for windows



to assemble it

1. download FASM
   from :
     http://flatassembler.net/
   or :
     https://github.com/the-little-language-designer/fasm

2. choose your platform
   by editing the first few lines of the source code
   if you are using linux :
      linux? equ yes
      windows? equ no
   if you are using windows :
      linux? equ no
      windows? equ yes

3. assemble the program by the following one way or another
   the command line interface of fasm :
      fasm -m 500000 cicada-nymph.fasm
   the fasm IDE (windows only)



the code of this program can be download from :
   https://github.com/the-little-language-designer/cicada-nymph
