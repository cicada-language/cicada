the little cicada-nymph is for teaching purpose at first

it reuses the code and idea
of the early version of cicada-language
to teach my friends
how to implement a interpreter
of a simple programming language

I will use assembly language (FASM for x86-64)
to implement the interpreter
the programming language to be implemented
is a threaded-code based (Forth-like) language

two versions of the interpreter is implemented
one for linux
one for windows



to assemble it :

1. download FASM
   from :
     http://flatassembler.net/
   or :
     https://github.com/the-little-language-designer/fasm

2. choose your platform
   by editing the first few lines of the source code
   if you are using linux :
      linux? equ yes
      windows? equ no
   if you are using windows :
      linux? equ no
      windows? equ yes

3. assemble the program by the following one way or another
   the command line interface of fasm :
      fasm -m 500000 cicada-nymph.fasm
   the fasm IDE (windows only) :
      File -> Open -> (choose the file)
      Options -> Compiler setup -> (set Memory to : 524288)
      Run -> Compile
      (output file will be saved in where the source file is)



the core.cn file is written in cicada-nymph
to show the use of "define-macro"
I define "if" "else" "then" by "define-macro" as macro in cicada-nymph
thus
when you are running the interpreter
if you copy the content of core.cn into the interpreter
then
the group of syntax key words "if" "else" "then"
will be available to you



to run it :

on linux :
   cicada-nymph is the output executable file
   you can run it by :
      ./cicada-nymph
   cn is a script that helps you to run the interpreter
   you can run it by :
      ./cn
   there is only one line in cn :
      cat core.cn - | ./cicada-nymph
   it is equivalent to run the interpreter by :
      ./cicada-nymph
   and copy the content of core.cn into the interpreter

on windows :
   cicada-nymph.exe is the output executable file
   you can run it by :
      1. double click it
      2. run cmd.exe
         switch to the directory where the cicada-nymph.exe lives
         and type the name of the program to run it
         (when you are typing the name
          you can press <tab> to do auto completion)
   sometimes it is problematic to run the interpreter on windows
   (due to the bug of windows)
   thus
   it is recommended to run the interpreter in emacs when you are using windows
